### Hi, 

Biomedical PHD student. new to GITHUB. excited to learn and explore. 

Loving this quote ðŸ”­...  "those who can imagine anything, create the impossible" - Alan Turing 

Currently reading ðŸ“„...  Against the Gods by Peter Bernstein and Risk by Hernan Diaz 

My interests mostly span human biology and fluid mechanics. 

Lately, I'm interested in machine learning... seems kinda complicated.... will update soon - 8/22/2023
